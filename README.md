MySpace was a place for friends. GuildSpace is a place for guilds.

Your guild gets a home on the web. Member profiles, rosters, DKP standings, bank inventories, raid history. It's all there when people show up, like a website. Because it is one.

## Why not just use Discord?

Discord is a chat app. Your guild's entire history lives in a corporate chatroom you don't control, behind terms of service that change whenever they want, scrolling into oblivion.

GuildSpace is not a chat app. Nobody needs to be online at the same time. You check the roster, look up someone's toons, see who made the last raid. It's a bulletin board, not a group chat.

## Why this is cheap to run

Real-time messaging is expensive. Expensive platforms need revenue. Revenue means ads, data harvesting, or paywalls. That's the treadmill every chat platform ends up on.

An asynchronous guild platform costs almost nothing compared to pushing millions of live messages. When your costs are low, you don't need to monetize your users.

**Advertising and monetization are banned on GuildSpace.** Not "we don't do it yet." Banned. There are no ads. There is no premium tier. Users are not the product.

No DMs. No adult content. No predator vectors. No age-gated content requiring biometric verification. Just guild pages and character profiles.

## Status

Early development. Ex Astra is the first guild on the platform.
